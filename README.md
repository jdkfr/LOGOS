# LOGOS
In archival storage systems dominated by write-once, read-rarely data, traditional sequential processing chains that first compress and then encrypt cause fragmentation, side-channel leakage, and computational overhead. We introduce LOGOS, a unified cryptographic compaction method designed for archival and potential online use. LOGOS achieves a consistent 8:1 lossless compression ratio while providing built-in confidentiality through a two-stage Latin square cascade. Each stage applies a deterministic bijective transformation using synchronized secret keys, ensuring complete reversibility and uniform diffusion without requiring entropy analysis.

The encoding process needs only 30 arithmetic operations per 8-bit block, making it deployable on resource-constrained devices like IoT loggers and firmware endpoints. Stateful decoding, reserved for infrequent retrieval or real-time communication scenarios, maintains injectivity through counter-synchronized preimage search. With a sub-100-byte memory footprint and type-agnostic data support, LOGOS eliminates format-dependent side channels and the layered overhead typical of conventional pipelines.

This demonstrates that high-density secure archival can be minimalist, algebraically provable, and practical for long-term storage workflows. The approach remains viable for bandwidth-constrained communication where traditional layered approaches prove inefficient. By unifying compression and encryption into a single primitive, LOGOS addresses fragmentation issues while maintaining security guarantees appropriate for archival contexts. The method's simplicity and efficiency make it particularly suitable for environments where computational resources are limited, but data integrity and confidentiality remain essential requirements.
